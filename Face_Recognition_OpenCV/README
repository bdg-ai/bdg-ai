Facial Recognition System with LBPH and OpenCV
=============================================

This project implements a facial recognition system using OpenCV's LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms) algorithm. The process is divided into three main steps: preparing images, training a model, and running real-time recognition.

Project Files:
--------------
1. **prepare.py** - Captures and saves face images.
2. **train.py** - Trains the LBPH model and generates `face_recognition_model.yml`.
3. **run.py** - Applies the trained model to recognize faces in real-time from a webcam or video source.

Setup Instructions:
-------------------
1. **Prepare Faces:**
   - This script detects and saves face images using Haar cascades.
   - Usage:
     ```
     python prepare.py
     ```
   - This will create a directory with saved face images for training automaticaly when running the camera.

2. **Train Model:**
   - This script trains the LBPH model with the collected face images.
   - Usage:
     ```
     python train.py
     ```
   - This will produce `face_recognition_model.yml`, the trained model file.

3. **Run Recognition:**
   - This script uses the trained model to perform real-time face recognition.
   - Usage:
     ```
     python run.py
     ```
   - Ensure a webcam or video source is connected to test real-time recognition.
