üöó Bird's Eye View Tracking with YOLOv8 and OpenCV üó∫Ô∏è

I developed a test project that detects and tracks vehicles, plotting their positions on a map to create a Bird's Eye View (BEV) of any situation. This is a beta version designed to showcase the potential of BEV mapping. While still in development, it effectively demonstrates how this technology can be applied in traffic management, logistics, or warehouse monitoring using existing security cameras and a floor plan.

Keypoints:
‚û° Real-Time Mapping: Detects and plots objects in real-time, providing an accurate BEV.

‚û° Customizable Setup: Compatible with multiple cameras, allowing you to monitor large areas on a single map. The homography is easily calculated by aligning four key points in the camera view (real life) with corresponding points on the map. This can be manually configured for precise tracking.

‚û° Warehouse Application: Perfect for enhancing security and operational efficiency in warehouses, tracking the movement of goods or vehicles with precision.

‚û° Homographic Transformation: Aligns camera detections with map coordinates for accurate tracking and analysis.

This solution empowers businesses with advanced object detection and real-time insights, optimizing operations and decision-making.
